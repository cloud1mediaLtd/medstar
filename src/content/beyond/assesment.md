At Medastra, we recognise that good communication skills are essential for success in the PLAB 2 exam and for a prosperous career as a doctor in the UK.

This 1 day communication course is suitable even for those who have already passed their PLAB exam and are seeking or have already secured a job in the NHS. It will not just help you professionally, but will also be of tremendous benefit personally as well as you settle into life in the UK.
