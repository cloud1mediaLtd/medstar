              Our aim is that all our students pass the PLAB exam in their first
              attempt. We don't believe in overburdening our students with
              unnecessary details and duplicate scenarios, or memorising lengthy
              scripts which we are against. Our course consists of specially
              designed frameworks, keys and guidance that will prepare you for
              any eventuality/scenario/presentation that you might encounter in
              your exam and you will be able to deal with it confidently and
              correctly. Furthermore, the written material is only supposed to
              be used in addition to attending the actual course either online
              or face-to-face. Many points that are just mentioned in the
              written material will be further explained and demonstrated during
              the course.

                Our course is unique because it is the ONLY course delivered by
                senior, practicing doctors within the NHS who have decades of
                clinical and medical training experience, thus making them the
                most qualified trainers by far!
              </li>
              <li>
                We follow GMC's guidance on Good Medical Practice and pride
                ourselves on our ethical practice.
              </li>
              <li>
                We offer a keynote lecture by a former GMC PLAB EXAMINER who
                will give you extremely valuable tips to be successful on the
                day of your exam.
              </li>
              <li>
                We offer you a UNIQUE 8 days of structured and supervised
                PRACTICE SESSIONS under timed exam conditions.
              </li>
              <li>We do NOT teach or encourage scripts.</li>
              <li>
                We do NOT teach or obtain real GMC PLAB cases as we believe this
                is very unethical and it puts candidates at a significant
                disadvantage trying to predict cases that might be different.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our mock exams are also conducted by the senior doctors to
                ensure that you receive the correct guidance and feedback in
                order to maximize your chances of success in the PLAB2 exam and
                beyond.
              </li>
              <li>
                You will get PERSONALISED feedback from a PLAB examiner on your
                performance in the mock exams.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will also have trained simulators as patients for the mock
                exams, just like you will face in the PLAB2 exam so that you are
                well prepared for this.
